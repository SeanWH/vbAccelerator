	<b>Disposable Information</b><br>
	What's On is an occasionally updated page devoted to the CDs and Records I buy.  This page should not be
	here but t
	<br><br>
	<b><a href="javascript:window.alert(&quot;http://www.warp-net.com/\nThis link was not retrieved.&quot;)" target="_top">Warp Records (http://www.warp-net.com)</a></b><br>
	If you like
	techno music you can't dance to and without a 4 to the floor beat then these records I recommend
	without hesitation.  Basically almost everything Warp have done will send me directly to the
	'Pseuds Corner' section of Private Eye. But then, John Peel always appeared there when
	he raved about records which specialised (only) in being less than 10 seconds long, which I 
	taped.  I guess the problem is that John Peel appeared there and still has his show (although
	he appears to have recently migrated into the suspect school of 'I'm old and therefore can afford to be
	excessively genial' journalism) whereas this selection of tracks will be merely dismissed 
	as the ravings of a madman with no mates.  Such is the way the world works.
	<ul>
	<li><b>LFO</b> <i>Frequencies</i> and <i>Advance</i>.<br>
	Frequencies is their first record and full of severe bass rumbling ideal if your "Car rides by with the Booming 
	System".  Play very loud.  Includes the number one tune of British
	pop chart <i>LFO</i> which was most appreciated by me because certain DJs on radio refused to play
	as "there is no chorus".  Advance is a deeper work which I think is often brilliant but
	a dinner party guest once described as "like tinnitus".  A higher recommendation is difficult to
	come by. Mark Bell of LFO also produced <b>Bjork's</b> <i>Homogenic</i> album and releases his
	less commercial stuff under the addictive Speed Jack moniker.  His latest track
	'A Tribute to All Those Who Said Fuck You' appeals at least in terms of its title if not the
	music. 
	<li><b>Autechre</b> <i>Incunabula</i>, <i>Amber</i>, <i>Chiassic Slide</i>, <i>Autechre</i><br>
	Autechre have only ever included one album note, which was 'Disposable Information, contains 
	some surface noise'. Their most recent record (<i>Autechre</i>) avoids such nonsense and includes
	neither any cover art or any markings on the CD.  UnderBOAC on this record has a drum
	rhythm fashioned from the most unlikely noises and an interesting processed vocal section about 
	the benefits of an unnamed washing powder.
	<li><b>Aphex Twin</b> <i>Richard D James Album</i><br>
	Most of Aphex Twin's output is characterised by an excessively overloaded sound which spells
	certain destruction for	minor speakers and is on now deleted twelve inches.  Buy them if you 
	find any!  Being named after a two-track tape recorder popular in the early 1960s, he says 'Oh, 
	and by the way, Aphex is a trade mark of Aphex Systems Limited and is used by permission'.  
	I am uncertain whether I am allowed to quote his recording name as a consequence.
	<li><b>Speedy J</b> <i>Ginger</i>, <i>G-Spot</i>.<br>  For some reason (almost certainly extremely low sales...) Jochem Paap (Speedy J refers to
	his habitual speed modification to +8 on Technics decks whilst DJing) moved to NovaMute for 
	his greatest record to date, 'Public Energy No.1". This aberrant behaviour is almost certainly
	the cause of the appaling title and (I couldn't believe this) the cliche of a <i>crop circle</i>
	pattern on the cover.  Nevertheless, Ginger is deep and tuneful, G-Spot is not quite right and
	'Public Energy No.1' is an unbelievably good record that sounds like nothing else, with beats being processed
	through vocoders and harmonic distortion.  Particularly on 'Haywire' and 'Hayfever'.
	<li><b>Nightmares On Wax</b> <i></i> <i>Smoker's Delight</i> <i>Carboot Soul</i><br>
	Another highly productive duo on the Warp label, Nightmares on Wax have struggled to produce
	three albums over the last two decades.  The tunes are usually either blindingly good or 
	"could not be fucked" mediocre but their influence on the UK dance music "scene" cannot be
	underestimated (actually, I read that in a music magazine).
