	<b><a href="!todo!.html" target="_top">1999</a></b><br>
	1999 - the year of the Eagle Transporter is here with us at last!  But regardless of the
	airbrushed hairstyles and strictly 1970s behaviour of the cheery American stars of that series, 
	what types of music could they have been listening to this year?
	<br><br>
	Frankly I thought I might as well give in at the start of this year.  All the music had been
	written already, everyone's records were rubbish, there was no new music... Of course there
	was new music in abundance just waiting to be discovered. 
	<br><br>
	Not that I discovered any of that, though.  Instead, I bought the collection described
	as follows.  But I ended up choosing these ones anyway.
	<ul>
	<li><b>Les Rythmes Digitales</b> <i>DarkDancer</i>.<br>
	The fantastic cover is all you really need to know about this one.  A three way airbrushe
	gatefold sleeve reveals the artiste (looking <i>ahem</i>  somewhat less acned that in 
	photographs of the same) opening a can of Pepsi, leading on to an all time
	80s classic montage of a Golf GTI and a woman in silver silk underwear, finally yielding to
	a series of ageing Digital syntheizers.
	<br><br>
	The music is a pastiche of various 1980s synth styles, performed using the instruments of the 
	times (including the crappy drum machines) and even going so far as using faded 1980s star 
	Nik Kershaw (last heard of advertising in the MusicMart magazine for friends) to sing one 
	of the tunes.
	<br><br>
	Complete and utterly pointless.  But it has such a fresh clean sound, and a sense of fun
	(&quot;Jacques Your Body&quot;?) that combined with the sleeve I have to rate it high. <br><br> 
	&quot;You complete and utter wanker&quot;, as they say.  9/10
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Stereolab</b> <i>Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night</i><br>
	Stereolab continue to work at the intersection between the techn
	
	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Plone</b> <i>For Beginner Piano</i><br>
	I love this record.  The best title too, and the CD is a severely minimalist purple.  Buy it!!!!
	The music is fantastic - imagine if Stereolab had just started with a set of children's toy instruments
	and a techno bent...  Not just that, but thank the Lord for a thanks list which misses out God, 
	MC Master Fucking Brilliant, DJ I Gave you a Freebie and various other arse-licking and 
	instead thanks a whole pile of actual people called Susan, Tim, Cath and Sam.  
	Fuck knows I would be happy to be an anonymous Steve in there...
	<br><br>


	<li><b>Capitol-K</b> <i>Sounds of the Empire</i><br>
	It's not always great, but the good bits make me want a whole lot more...  A
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Orbital</b> <i>Middle Of Nowhere</i><br>
	Review to come.	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Spring Heel Jack</b> <i>Treader</i><br>
	Review to come.	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Chemical Brothers</b> <i>Surrender</i><br>
	Review to come.	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Groove Armada</b> <i>Vertigo</i><br>
	Review to come.	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Scott 4</b> <i>Works Project LP</i><br>
	Review to come.	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Puff Daddy</b> <i>PE2000 (remix)</i><br>
	Puff Daddy updates the all-time best hip-hop tune - everyone holds their breath - have PE sold out
	for good for the cash?  Will Puff Daddy turn it into #1 selling mush with female soul vocalists?
	No!  This version has the same wondeful JB's sample with <i>that</i> rhythm looping over and over  
	(still uncredited!) and	some nice scratching.  But the thing about this one is whilst the PE version 
	was just mouthing off about money and cars and their public profile and stuff,  Puff Daddy really 
	<i>is</i> the Public Enemy referred to in the lyrics... <br><br> Single of the year, 10/10.
	<br><br>


	<li><b>Add-N-To-X</b> <i>Avant Hard</i><br>
	Review to come.	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Capitol K</b> <i>These are the Sounds</i><br>
	Review to come.	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Scritti Politti</b> <i>Anomie and Bonhomie</i><br>
	Review to come.	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Regular Fries</b> <i>Accept The Signal</i><br>
	Review to come.	
	<br><br>

	<li><b>u-Ziq</b> <i>Royal Astronomy</i><br>
	Wrongly reviewed by many as the record where u-Ziq's Mike Paradinas sold out to the commercial crowd,
	this record is as just as noisy as all of his recent output; it just has the advantage of being one
	of the first records he wrote that you can listen to; but even listen to with pleasure.  I don't
	know about you but when I hear a track like &quot;Autumn Acid&quot; which pitch a synth through a 
	distortion pedal and where it keeps spilling over into resonant tones I just know I want to go 
	dancing.
	<br><br>
	Noisy, bassy, swearing and some acid basslines.  7/10.
	<br><br>

	</ul>

	<b>Not 1999</b><br>
	So, I bought these records in the wrong year. In many cases I feel I had no choice, if you must know.
	<br><br>

	<ul>

	<li><b>Cymande</b> <i>The Message (Collected)</i><br>
	<br><br>

	<li><b>I-F</b> <i>Fucking Consumer</i><br>
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Tortoise</b> <i>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</i><br>
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Orbital</b> <i>Orbital (Brown Album)</i><br>
	<br><br>

	<li><b>Various</b> <i>Super Break Beats</i><br>
	This, finally, is the break beat record I waited for all my life.  Every record that comes on is
	instantly recognisable as one of the top class Hip Hop breaks to anyone following 
	the Hip-Hop scene 1985-1995, and the Camille Yarbrough's &quot;Praise You&quot; 
	is so much better than the dismal mess made of it in the version by that loser F*tb*y Sl*m.
