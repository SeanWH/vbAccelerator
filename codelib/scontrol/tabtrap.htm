	<b>Overview</b><br>
	Right.  You are trying to create a control in VB, and your control has to catch the Tab key.
	It might be a grid, where you would expect tab to move between cells, or it might be an editor
	control (such as my forthcoming RichEdit control).  This is not an unreasonable request of any
	programming language which lets you create a control.  Or is it?  Want to go mad?  You will if
	you try to intercept Tabs properly in VB unless someone tells you the answer...
	<br><br>
	This article is here to show you a brilliant technique but also may
	help you interpret <a href="..\..\headline.htm#traitor">Bruce McKinney's</a>
	assertion that "VB makes the easy things easy, but...".
	<br><br>
	The code provided here is based on code and a Type Library put together by Matt Curland,
	Bill Storage and Mike Gainer.
	<br><br>
	<b>Tabs And Stuff</b><br>
	There are two ways to look at the tab key problem.  Firstly, if you're working in VB you 
	can set TabStop to False for all controls on the form.  Then, <i>theoretically</i> all controls
	intercept the Tab key. I personally find the TabStop property to work somewhere between
	dubious and ineffective. No matter.  Having set TabStop to false, you're then on your own 
	about Tab processing.  If a control intercepts the tab key, its really up to you what you do.  
	People have been acclaimed as masters of Visual Basic for coding large forms which are in 
	control of tabs without using the TabStop property.  However, there is a fundamental encapsulation
	problem here.  When you want to intercept the Tab key on one control, you have the large scale
	issue of coding Tab handling for all other controls on the form. You can't just write the code
	into the only control which requires the Tab.
	<br><br>
	<b>Don't Even Go There</b><br>
	That's just trying to code a VB only control which intercepts tabs.  A much more difficult
	problem occurs if you're trying to do something out of the ordinary, such as intercept keys
	in a window you have created using the Windows API.  This was my problem for over a year on
	the <a href="..\odcbolst\article.htm">Owner-Draw Combo and List Box Control</a>.  VB firmly 
	refuses to acknowledge an API
	window as something which can partake in the tab order unless you can somehow tell it that's
	what you want to do.  (You can check out some more examples of this occuring if you 
	download any of the controls at <a href="..\..\linx.htm#secrgns">Ramon's VB5 Net Stop</a>.)
	Forms appear to have control windows integrated but as soon as you press Tab, nothing happens.
	<br><br>	
	<b>Toughest Kid in the Infants</b><br>
	The issue of trapping tabs in controls is one that is is designed into the
	ActiveX control specification.  The problem you have in VB with this is that there is no
	obvious way of getting at this functionality.  All ActiveX controls must implement the
	<i>IOleInPlaceActiveObject</i> interface which covers a variety of interfacing issues 
	between the control and its parent, including control activation, context sensitive help,
	drawing resize borders and responding to accelerator keys (including the Tab key).  The
	implementation of this interface is preset and buried within a VB control.  You can
	override the preset implementation, however.
	<br><br>
	The first thing you need to do this is a Type Library (TLB) which interfaces VB to the
	COM interface.  This TLB is only required when working in the VB IDE, and tells VB where
	the calls to be made are located within the OLE DLLs.  When you compile a sample using this
	Type Library, VB compiles in the references to the calls and you no longer require the
	TLB file.  The Type Library is available from the <a href="..\..\typelib.htm">Type Library Resource
	Page</a>, and is called OleGuids.Tlb.  Unzip this file
	to a suitable directory and register it either using VB, by choosing Project-References then
	clicking Browse and picking the file, or by downloading the <a href="..\tlb\vbregtlb.htm">VB TLB registration utility</a>
	and using that.
	<br><br>
	Once this library is in place, you need to be able to intercept VB's existing implementation
	of IOLEInPlaceActiveObject and replace it with a customised one.  As we are only interested
	here in intercepting Tabs at run-time, the only time you need to modify the interface is when
	the control gets focus.  To do this, the code subclasses the
	<i>WM_SETFOCUS</i> message for the control, allowing VB to process it first.  Once VB is
	done with it, the code then uses various arcane hacks to modify the vtable of the 
	UserControl object, replacing
	the existing IOLEInPlaceActiveObject interface pointers with a new set pointing to VB
	functions implemented in a module, <b>mIOLEInPlaceActiveObject.Bas</b>.  As a consequence, 
	TranslateAccelerator calls are routed to the version
	in your code.  It is then a simple matter to return the COM code <i>S_OK</i> after getting
	the Tab key, thus informing the ActiveX interface that the key is wanted in the control.
	The mIOLEInPlaceActiveObject module has to communicate TranslateAccelerator events 
	with the control.  To achieve this without setting up a circular reference between the control
	and the module (which would prevent the control from ever terminating), un-referenced object
	pointers are used.  These are set up during the <i>UserControl_Initialize</i> event and
	cleared at <i>UserControl_Terminate</i>. Check out <a href="..\ssubtmr\ssubtmr.htm">Subclassing
	without the crashes</a> for more information about using object pointers to prevent circular
	references.
	<br><br>
	The code to implement this is mad. If you want to do it, you'll just want to copy
	code from another project into your own (you're not going to remember how to do it every time!).
	For this reason the download TabCatch project provides a bare-bones template for implementing 
	Tab interception in controls.
	<br><br>
	<b>J'Accuse</b><br>
	This doesn't seem reasonable. I've been visiting MSDN over the last month to look at
	the OLE interfaces which have to be implemented between ActiveX controls and their container 
	(such as VB, IE, Word etc).  The more I read about it the more I think that VB's designers 
	left out too many interfaces.  VB's job is to make things easier, but how difficult
	would it have been to add a TranslateAccelerator implementation?  Does it have to impossible to
	access the other OLE interfaces such as the one which controls run-time size of your control, the
	one which controls whether you can negotiate space in the non-client area of the parent and so
	on?  These are COM interfaces after all, so why are we <u>stuck</u> with a narrow 
	preset implementation unless you make hacks like described here?
	 <br><br>
	<b>Deal With It</b><br>
	This article is headed "Part 1" because it is vbAccelerator's aim to give you a DLL which fixes
	the lack of OLE interface support in VB without making the code like pulling out your toenails.
	Stay tuned for more!
