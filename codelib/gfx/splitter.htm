	<p>
	The cSplitter class demonstrates a very simple way to add splitter functionality to your application.
	There are undoubtedly more flexible and difficult ways of doing this (I'm currently trying to develop one
	using transparent windows) but this is the method I've used up to now.
	<br><br>
	In this method, a PictureBox is used as the splitter for the form.  The splitter class automatically
	sets the MousePointer for the PictureBox to the NS or EW depending on the orientation you want, so when
	the mouse moves over the PictureBox, the user sees that they can click and drag the splitter in the
	right direction.
	<br><br>
	When the user clicks on it, the Splitter class then calls the SetCapture method to redirect subsequent
	MouseMoves onto the owning form of the splitter.  This makes it easier to work out where the splitter
	should be positioned as the mouse moves over the form.  Finally, when the mouse is released, the class
	evaluates if the splitter is being dropped with allowable bounds, releases the mouse capture to the form
	and raises an event saying the split is complete.
	<br><br>
	Here is the code:
