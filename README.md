# vbAccelerator
This is a complete clone of the website from around 2006.  Includes all of the source code, both VB and C#.
I was going through some old backups of stuff that I had and came across the zip I had of the copy of vbAccelerator I had made sometime in 2006.  This was after Steve McMahon had stopped updating the site, and so it appears to be a complete snapshot of the site as it was then.

I have not been through every web page in the copy, and it is quite possible, although unlikely, that some of it is broken.  Report it as an issue and I'll see what I can do.
