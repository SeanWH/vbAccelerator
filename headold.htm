		Also, at <a href="linx.htm#secdevx">DevX</a>, on 18 January, 
		Bruce McKinney, author of Hardcore Visual Basic (probably the best VB coding book on sale),
		announced in an <a href="javascript:window.alert(&quot;http://www.vb-zone.com/upload/free/features/vbpj/1999/mckinney/mckinney1.asp\nThis link was not retrieved.&quot;)" target="_top">article</a>
		that he was no longer going to write any more editions.  At
		the same time he heretically announced that he would be doing future programming
		in Delphi because &quot;VB makes the easy things easier; Delphi makes the hard things
		easier&quot;.  There are a couple of upsides to this:
		<ol>
		<li>Hardcore Visual Basic is now effectively a free product.  The entire text of the
		book is available at MSDN and in the VB6 Help file (Bruce M says, not verified by me) and now
		for the first time you can also download all the source code for free also.  This is a good thing.
		<a href="javascript:window.alert(&quot;http://www.vb-zone.com/upload/free/features/vbpj/1999/mckinney/mckinney2a.asp\nThis link was not retrieved.&quot;)#2" target="_top">Go get it!</a> 
		Source code for both VB5 and a revised VB6 version is provided.
		<li>If you're interested in VB, its problems, and some ideas of things to ask Microsoft for
		in VB7, then there is a

		</ol>
		vbAccelerator is not about to follow this lead.  Obviously it would be far too difficult
		for a start (changing the domain name, redoing all the logos...) More seriously, VB 
		still hasn't let me down yet.  Yes, there are some issues with the VB language and a
		lack of support for many features we really should have.  But there are plenty of 
		workarounds and other times its good to have a the challenge :)  One issue you can't
		help but agree with is the way VB6 has broken VB5 code without there being any real
		justification (for example, UserControls calling the Resize and ReadProperties events
		in the opposite order...).  vbAccelerator is starting a new series of articles next
		month considering some of these issues.  The initial articles are going to cover
		<i>Implementing interfaces rather than using events</i> and <i>Can you
		create a control with a Toolbar style collection interface (and have it work)?</i>

		The <i>With</i> statement in VB is a nice language feature which can make
		code easier to write and maintain.  However, there's a big catch to it, pointed out in an article by
		Dave Jewell in the UK magazine <a href="javascript:window.alert(&quot;http://www.pcpro.co.uk/\nThis link was not retrieved.&quot;)">PC Pro</a>.<br><br>
		When you use <i>With</i> to refer to an object, VB will call the COM <i>AddRef</i>
		method on the object.  Only when the <i>End With</i> statement is reached is COM's
		<i>Release</i> method called.  This means that if you're code breaks out of a <i>With</i>...<i>End With</i>
		statement block for any reason, VB will have taken out a permanent reference on that
		object.  Objects cannot clear up properly unless there are no outstanding references
		on them or when your executable terminates!  This code fragment shows how you can get into 
		serious difficulties with this:<br><br>
		</font>
<font face="Lucida Console,courier new" size="1" color="#000000">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim c As cWorker<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim fResult As Double<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Error Goto ErrorHandler<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set c = MainObject.Worker(1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Iterations = 1000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.InitialValue = 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ProgressLabel = lblStatus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.DoProcess<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fResult = .Value<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End With<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ErrorHandler:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LogError 2501,"Processing Failed: " & Err.Description<br>
<br>
</font>
	        <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">	
		If for any reason the code raises an error during the <i>With</i> block above, the
		object <i>c</i> will <u>never</u> terminate whilst your project is running.  It will
		just float somewhere around in memory until the project completes because of the
		outstanding reference.  You can try to set <i>c</i> to nothing in the error handler, 
		but this still won't terminate the object because the <i>With</i> block has taken out 
		another reference on it!
		<br><br>
		Although this 'feature' is mentionned somewhere in the VB documentation 
		it isn't particularly well known.
		The conclusion is that if you're using <i>With</i>...<i>End With</i> you better be
		very careful...

		The January 1999 release of vbAccelerator brings with it major new versions of two
		of the highest profile controls on the site: the 
		<a href="codelib\cpopmenu\article.htm">Icon Menu Control</a> and the 
		<a href="codelib\odcbolst\article.htm">Owner-Draw Combo and List Box Control</a>.<br><br>
		The Icon Menu Control gains many new features with this release: the ability to insert
		or remove menu items, making the control much easier to use, the ability to track menu
		items which have had the VB <i>.Visible</i> property set to False and also it is now
		capable of working in MDI projects with multiple child menus.
		<br><br>
		The Owner-Draw Combo and List Box control has not changed so much, but the changes that
		have been made approach the state-of-the-art in hardcore VB coding.  The previous 
		release of this control worked in most SDI applications, but it had a hacked 
		implementation of focus which caused it to fail on MDI forms, and it sometimes
		 caused GPFs.  The new version overrides VB's implementation of focus for ActiveX controls
		by modifying the control's vtable to ensure absolutely correct focus implementation.
		Not just this but the only other outstanding bug, which was a failure to size correctly
		according to the selected font, has been fixed.  The fixing in this control paves the
		way to the full implementation of ComboBoxEx, TreeView and ListView controls in VB for
		future releases of the site.  Cool!
		<br><br>
		Oh, I can't leave it here without mentionning that the long-promised <a href="codelib\custclip\goldfish.htm">Goldfish</a>
		application is now finally release and available for download.

	vbAccelerator does not yet own a copy of Visual Basic 6, so the 
	code originated for this site isn't available as VB6 native executables.  However, there should be no
	problem moving most of the code from VB5 to VB6.  And since <a href="mission.htm">all the source code is provided</a> 
	on this site you can always recompile it yourself!<br><br>
	Please change any OCX or DLL names before recompiling in VB6 to prevent incompatibility.  
	If you are feeling particularly public spirited, you could even 
	<a href="mailto:steve@vbaccelerator.com">post me</a> the VB6 version! (as usual, other 
	code, cash, cheques, cuddly toys etc will also be gratefully received :)<br><br>
		Here at vbAccelerator we're not too sure about VB6.  There's some neat new extensions
		(WebClasses, DHTML forms, UDTs in ActiveX, lightweight controls, possibly the DTD stuff) but what
		happened to the all the great new hacking tools we could have had?  Comparing this
		release to VB5 it seems that things aren't going forward in the right way.<br><br>
		Where are cool new features that would really make you want to program in VB like
		inheritance, proper multi-threading support, fixes to the dire collection 
		object, easier subclassing, proper menu and toolbar 
		integration, docking windows, more OLE type libraries and so on?<br><br>
		Some of the new VB6 features don't seem to be helpful either.  The CallByName 
		feature is flawed because it takes the simple option and thus requires a public object.
		Object persistance suffers in the same way.  A potentially nice new feature is that
		you can create a control at run-time.  But this has the same problem as VB5 does when
		you create an object that has events at runtime - you have to set up a withevents
		class at design time to intercept the events!  Another issue is the completely new
		OCX implementations for COMCTL32.DLL. Why do we need a new incompatible OCX just to put
		in a few new features?  Surely this isn't because otherwise VB5 programmers 
		could use it?  Also, the use of owner-draw in the new OCX version to create relatively
		useless features such as item colouration is seriously misguided (IMHO).
		<br><br>
		Compare this to the stuff that was added in VB5 (OCXs, AddressOf, Implements, 
		ObjPtr, CopyMemory (?)...) and to me it seems that VB6 is a bum deal.
		<br><br>
		I'm sure I'm wrong about at least half of this.  What do you think?
