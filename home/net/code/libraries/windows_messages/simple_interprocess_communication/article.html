Whilst the .NET Framework has some very sophisticated
techniques for communication between processes on different machines, it doesn't provide
so much support for communication between processes on the <span class="i">same</span> 
machine.  The Windows API offers a rich set of inter-process communications features, at various 
levels of sophistication.  This sample demonstrates using one of the simplest techniques,
the <span class="code">WM_COPYDATA</span> message.  VB.NET and C# code provided.
</p><h2>WM_COPYDATA</h2><p>
The <span class="code">WM_COPYDATA</span> message in the Windows API is specifically designed to make it
easier to send a block of data between two applications in different processes.  Each process running on
a Windows System has its own virtual address space which means that different processes see completely
different data even if it has the same memory address.  <span class="code">WM_COPYDATA</span> runs at
a lower level in the system and is hence capable of copying memory between process address spaces.  When
you call it, it allocates a new block of memory in the recipients address space, copies the data you
provided it into the new block and then notifies the recipient application, which can then read the 
memory.  Windows does not allow the recipient application to change the received structure (even if
you did the change would be local to the recipient and not seen back at the caller).
    </p><p>
This makes it a useful message for sending data between applications and directing other applications to 
perform work.  However, it requires cooperation between the sending application and the receiving application. 
The receiving application must know the format of the information.  The sending application must know the
format of the data and cannot modify the memory referenced by any pointers.   The data must also be entirely
contained in the block that's being sent: you cannot send a reference to another object, for example, since
the recipient would simply recieve a long memory pointer which would not point to anything useful in its
address space.
    </p><h2>Using WM_COPYDATA</h2><p>
In this section I'll look at two things; firstly, how to place an object (which may refer to other objects) 
into a memory block for sending and secondly how the sender can identify the recipient.
</p><h3>Writing an Object into a Memory Block</h3><p>
The .NET Framework includes a lot of support for <span class="code">Serialization</span>.  When you
serialize an object, you convert it to a form that can be persisted to some other location, from where
it can be read again (deserialized) to reconstitute and object that contains the same information
as the original.  This provides an easy way to convert any object into a block of memory which
you can pass around.
</p><p>
There are two ways to go about serialization:
</p><ol><li>Marking the class with the <span class="code">Serializable</span> attribute.
<p>
Once you've done this, the .NET Framework will automatically provide a serialization/
deserialization implementation which acts on the public fields within the object.
This is nice and simple but the implementation doesn't call the object's
constructor, and if your object contains private fields or read-only properties
then it is unsuitable.  Note that this attribute is not inherited if you create a 
subclass of the object.
</p></li><li>Implement the <span class="code">ISerializable</span> interface.
<p>
If you need more control, you can implement <span class="code">ISerializable</span>.
To do this means implementing a method for serializing, <span class="code">GetObjectData</span>,
and providing a special constructor for deserializing with the same arguments as 
<span class="code">GetObjectData</span>.  In each case you get a <span class="code">SerializationInfo</span>
object which allows you to Add and Get values from the serialized buffer.
</p></li></ol><p>
Once an object supports serialization, it can be written to a block of memory using a
<span class="code">MemoryStream</span>:
</p><pre>
   BinaryFormatter b = new BinaryFormatter();
   MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
   b.Serialize(stream, obj);
   stream.Flush();			
</pre><p>
To actually get that memory into a form that you can use with Interop you need to
copy its contents to a block of memory, so you can then get a pointer from it:
</p><pre>
   int dataSize = stream.Length;
   byte[] data = new byte[dataSize];
   stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
   stream.Read(data, 0, dataSize);
   IntPtr ptrData = Marshal.AllocCoTaskMem(dataSize);
   Marshal.Copy(data, 0, ptrData, dataSize);

   ... use it here

   // Clear up the data:
   Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem(ptrData);
</pre><h3>Identifying Recipients</h3><p>
Before you send any data, you need to be able to identify who you're sending it to.
In the case of a <span class="code">WM_COPYDATA</span> message, that means knowing
the Window handle of the object that receives the message.
</p><p>
Whenever you're sending information between processes, there are various ways to
allow processes to know about each other.  You can use a known file, or a known
location in the registry to identify objects. However, since you are responsible
for writing to the known location when your object is created, and clearing the
information again when the object is destroyed, this can lead to problems if
there is a crash.  A much more reliable way is if you can detect
recipients on the basis of their Window, since when the Window is destroyed
it automatically gets removed from the recipients list.
</p><p>
To do this you can use the Windows Properties database.  Any Window can be
marked with a named property using the API <span class="code">SetProp</span>
call, and a Window can be queried for a property with a particular name using
<span class="code">GetProp</span></p><p>
Therefore to identify recipients all you need to be able to do is to
enumerate the Windows on the system, and check the properties.  The
article <a href="..\..\windows\enumerating_windows\article.html">Enumerating Windows</a> describes
how to go through all the windows on the system, so for each Window
that is returned you just need to check for the property:
</p><pre>
   [DllImport("user32", CharSet=CharSet.Auto)]
   private extern static int GetProp(
      IntPtr hwnd , 
      string lpString);
   [DllImport("user32", CharSet=CharSet.Auto)]
   private extern static int SetProp(
      IntPtr hwnd , 
      string lpString, 
      int hData);
   [DllImport("user32", CharSet=CharSet.Auto)]
   private extern static int RemoveProp(
      IntPtr hwnd, 
      string lpString);



   // Enumerate all windows which have the
   // channel name, send the data to each one
   EnumWindows ew = new EnumWindows();
   ew.GetWindows();

   // Send the data to each window identified on
   // the channel:
   foreach(EnumWindowsItem window in ew.Items)
   {
      if (!window.Handle.Equals(this.owner.Handle))
      {
         if (GetProp(window.Handle, this.channelName) != 0)
         {
             ...
         }
      }
   }
</pre><h2>Wrapping it up: Using the Code</h2><p>
The sample code provides a <span class="code">CopyData</span> class which
brings together the techniques and wraps up sending and receiving data
between applications.  To use it, you create an instance of the 
<span class="code">CopyData</span> class, and connect up the
<span class="code">DataReceived</span> event.  You then attach the
class to an instance of a Form using the <span class="code">AssignHandle</span>
method and create some "channels" to send and receive data on.
A "channel" is a convenience: if you need 
to send multiple different types of data life is easier if you can easily
determine which type you've received.  By setting up different channels for
different types, on receipt of the data you can check which channel it was
sent on.  If you only ever send one type of data you just create a single 
channel.  Once you've done that, you can send data to any recipient using
a particular channel using the <span class="code">Send</span> method.
Here's an overview of the setup for a single channel:
</p><pre>
   private CopyData copyData = null;

   private void frm_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
   {
      // Create a new instance of the class:
      copyData = new CopyData();
			
      // Assign the handle:
      copyData.AssignHandle(this.Handle);

      // Create the channel to send on:
      copyData.Channels.Add("MyDataChannel");     

      // Hook up received event:
      copyData.DataReceived += new DataReceivedEventHandler(
        copyData_DataReceived);
   } 

   private void copyData_DataReceived(object sender, DataReceivedEventArgs e)
   {
      // Cast the data to the type of object we sent:
      MyObject m = (MyObject) e.Data

      // .. do something with the data.
   }

   private void SendData(MyObject m)
   {
      // m must be serializable.
      int recipients = copyData.Channels["MyDataChannel"].Send(data);
   }
</pre><h2>Using The Framework - Remoting between applications on the same machine</h2><p>
If you have ever delved briefly into .NET Remoting you will have seen that this is
the .NET Framework's version of DCOM, albeit much more controllable, particularly
around which ports communication will be on.  Surely this can be used to communicate
between applications on the same machine?
</p><p>
The answer is that it can.  However, there are two difficulties; firstly you need
to be able to perform TCP/IP communications;
on local host port (127.0.0.1) which probably requires that the machine you are running on
has a network card installed and secondly it can be difficult to identify the remoting
target.  If you're interested in doing it, though, the article 
<a href="javascript:window.alert(&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwinforms/html/reaworapps1.asp\nThis link was not retrieved.&quot;)">Real World Applications Sample Part 1</a> 
describes the steps involved in communication.  It uses the registry as the shared place to store the name of the proxy
object which can be accessed from different instances.  The steps are basically:
</p><h3>1. Recipient Application</h3><ul><li>Create an instance of a class derived from <span class="code">MarshalByRefObject</span>.</li><li>Call <span class="code">RemotingServices.Marshal</span> to publish the object.</li><li>Create a <span class="code">TcpChannel</span> and configure it to bind to localhost on 
port 0.</li><li>Get the name of the object back from <span class="code">TcpChannel</span> and put it 
somewhere that another application will be able to access it from, for example, a file
or to the registry.</li></ul><h3>2. Sending Application</h3><ul><li>Look in the place you wrote the name of the object to in step 1.4 for the recipient's
object name.</li><li>Call <span class="code">RemotingServices.Connect</span> to get a proxy to the object.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
This article provides a easy to use wrapper around the <span class="code">WM_COPYDATA</span> class
that you can add to any .NET Windows Forms application (with unmanaged code permissions).  This
allows you to very easily send data between applications. 
</p><p>
Examples of places where you can use this sort of messaging include creating a custom TraceListener
which sends messages to a Window and synchronizing a Start Page showing recently used documents when
you can have multiple instances of your app running (just like VS.NET doesn't!)
