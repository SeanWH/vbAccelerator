      <title>Writing Audio CDs</title>
      <link>http://vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/Libraries/Writing_CDs/Writing_Audio_CDs/article.asp</link>
      <description>"Perhaps they were expecting someone to write an audio recorder in Visual Basic?"
Paul DiLascia writes, somewhat sarcastically, in the April 2004 issue of 
MSDN Magazine on the subject of the
Image Mastering API.  Whether they were expecting it or not, here it is: a VB application 
which creates audio CDs.

      <title>Using WinAmp In Plugins From VB</title>
      <link>http://vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/vbMedia/Audio/Using_WinAmp_Plugins/article.asp</link>
      <description>
Winamp is one of the better music player applications out there, and one of the neat
features is its extensive support for plugins, most of which are developed and made
available independently from Winamp.  This article provides a small DLL and source
which allows you to use these plugins to play and convert audio files relatively easily from VB.  
It has been tested with the MP3, MP4/AAC, APE (Monkey's Audio) and Ogg Vorbis plugins; it should
work fine with the other plugins for more esoteric tracker and console formats out there 
too.

IMAPI is provided with Windows XP and above to provide full control over the creation
of audio and data discs.  This sample provides a wrapper around the API allowing it to be 
used from VB.

      <title>Creating New Desktops and Running Applications</title>
      <link>http://vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/Libraries/Windows/Creating_New_Desktops/article.asp</link>
      <description>
All varieties of Windows NT since 3.51 include the ability to create and run multiple desktops.
Normally, this feature isn't used, and all applications run within the "Default"
desktop.  However, if you want to create a kiosk-style application which has a full-screen
interface, and prevents Ctrl+Alt+Del or any of the other standard Windows options from
being accessed, then this technique is the way to do it.

      <title>CD Ripping in VB Part 1</title>
      <link>http://vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/vbMedia/Audio/CD_Ripping_1/article.asp</link>
      <description>
This sample looks at ripping CDs from VB using the CD ripping library
provided with CDEx.  In addition to providing
a VB compatible wrapper around the CD ripping functions, it provides a buffered WAV file
writer which can be reused for other applications such as audio recorders and processors.

      <link>http://vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Type_Libraries/IMAPI_(CD_Burning)/article.asp</link>
      <description>This type library provides access to the various objects exposed
in the Windows Image Mastering API (IMAPI).  This API allows you to burn
audio and data CD-R and CD-RW discs.  Note that this API is only available
on Windows XP and above.</description>

      <title>Preventing Logoff or Shutdown</title>
      <link>http://vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Tips/Preventing_Logoff_or_Shutdown/article.asp</link>
      <description>
Sometimes if an application is performing a long operation you do not want the
user to log-off or shutdown the system until it is complete.  An example is
when burning a CD, as the CD burn will be terminated and the disc potentially
ruined.  This sample demonstrates how to respond to the WM_QUERYENDSESSION
message to prevent this from occurring.

      <title>Mapping NT Device Names to Drive Letters and vice-versa</title>
      <link>http://vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Tips/Mapping_NT_Device_Names/article.asp</link>
      <description>
This tip demonstrates how you convert between MS-DOS style drive letters and NT-style device
names.  This can be useful if you're working with an API that exposes an NT device name,
such as IMAPI for CD Burning.

      <title>Runnable Type Library (Runnable.TLB)</title>
      <link>http://vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Type_Libraries/Runnable/article.asp</link>
      <description>This Type Library was originally provided with the CodeFlow sample from the VB Owner's Area at MSDN. It contains only one interface declaration (which could equally be written in VB as a class) but does allow an ActiveX object to be created without its public interface being cluttered with items the user of the object does not care about.</description>
