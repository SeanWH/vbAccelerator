        <img src="images\trhead.gif" width="363" height="29" alt="Man Changes Programming Language"><br><br>
	In an announcement on Monday 18 January, a programmer made clear he was going to change the language
	he uses to write computer programs.  
	<br><br>
	The suprise announcement, thought to be the first instance of such a switch, caused shock
	and outrage amongst the programming community.  
	<br><br>
	Programming Newsgroups, renowned for their
	in-depth and timely discussions, immediately jammed up 
	with messages on the subject such as &quot;See I always told you my programming language was better than yours,
	nah!&quot;, &quot;Hey I thought it was you, let's meet up a VBITS and have a laugh&quot; and &quot;Hot sex
	xxx download a teenage porn hamster&quot;.  
	<br><br>
	Our reporters took to the streets to ask people what they thought about the switch.  
	<br><br>
	<b>Penis</b><br>
	&quot;I don't
	know what the hell a programming language is, and stop wasting my bloody time&quot;, said James Parsnip, a
	young banker, from his specially registered Porsche.  &quot;Oh, but while you're here,
	I'm having problems pasting a mail into Excel and sending it through Notes via Access to my client
	who hasn't got a computer, how do I do it?&quot;,
	the thrusting but overweight banker asked before speeding off.
	<br><br>
	<b>Crowd Pleaser</b><br>	
	Computer industry members were clearly in a turmoil about how to handle the
	news. One ex-programmer didn't give his name, but did tell us he had been forced to stop coding 
	in order to earn a living wage and now instead had to use a program only known by its codename 
	&quot;PeopleSoft&quot;.  When pressed for a quote regardless he did say 
	&quot;This is all wibble and I'm a goat breeder&quot;.
	<br><br>
	<b>There I Was, Completely Naked and Covered in Pasta</b><br>	
	Lisa Marchant-Henbury, a computer professional working with an Internet consultancy said 
	&quot;I've no idea why you even need a language at all, Shockwave does all that, doesn't it?&quot; before rushing off
	to pitch a &quot;<i>totally</i> awesome new site - we've got rid of the <i>passe</i> navigation links, instead
	there are continually rushing bubbles whose colour and image represents the feel of the
	product&quot;.
	<br><br>
	vbAccelerator's reporter was forced to make his excuses and hang around, asking if a beer or dinner
	might be on the cards.
